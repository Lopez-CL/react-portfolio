# My Portfolio
*Site in Progress*

__Description:__ This is my portfolio capturing my multi-disciplinary background as a digital literacy & emerging technologies librarian and an aspiring full stack software engineer. A couple of details about the site:

* Deployed on GitHub Pages using [gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) npm package. Visit [my portfolio](https://lopez-cl.github.io/react-portfolio/). Apologies for any delay in latest feature updates showing.
* This is a React application. I'm drawn to the frictionless UX a single page application framework like React can provide, specifically the flexibility and dynamism of functional components and React hooks.
* The CSS is entirely custom. While I could have easily used a library to bootstrap the styling and animations, I wanted to give my interest and skill set in CSS3 a sandbox to play in.
